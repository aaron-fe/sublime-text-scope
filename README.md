Sublime Text 2 language scope map

If you need to create a snippet in sublime text 2,
and you don't know what is the right scope for your snippet,
you can look for your language scope in `scope.md`.

If you found that the scope listed in `scope.md` is not working,
you may need to run `node generate-scope.js` to update the scope.md.

Before you run `node generate-scope.js`,
you need to run `npm install chalk` to install chalk module.
